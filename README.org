* Intro
  The fourinarow.tcl file contains a minimal, yet complete, bot for
  the four in a row game from The AI Games. The file contains all the
  necessary information to get started!

* Debugging
  Debugging a bot is easy. Just run the script and input some protocol
  commands. You can mix these with regular tcl commands to print
  values of variables. For instance:

  #+BEGIN_SRC tcl
    settings timebank 10000
    settings time_per_move 500
    settings player_names player1,player2
    settings your_bot player1
    settings your_botid 1
    settings field_columns 7
    settings field_rows 6
    puts $settings

    update game round 1
    puts $round

    update game field 0,0,0,0,0,0,0;0,0,0,0,0,0,0;0,0,0,0,0,0,0;0,0,0,0,0,0,0;0,0,0,0,0,0,0;0,0,0,0,0,0,0
    puts $field

    action move 10000
  #+END_SRC

  Or, for convenience, you can create files with different
  scenarios. Then, when you want to test a certain scenario, you can
  simply pipe that file to the script.
